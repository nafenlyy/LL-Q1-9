            <h1>Situation of Sitio Bebe</h1>
            <p>The residents of Sitio Bebe suffer from a variety of problems, including poor access to healthcare, troubles with their principal jobs, and problems with the local environment. They will need a variety of approaches to address their health issues and improve their general well-being, including access to clean water, the development of healthcare infrastructure, opportunities for job training, and specific actions to address respiratory problems and other health issues.</p>
            <h2>Problems facing Sitio Bebe:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Closing of mines and factories - Mines and factories began to temporarily close, resulting in job losses and economic difficulties for residents.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Lack of Access to Clean Water - The community is not near a natural water source, residents must rely on the local government to import clean water or dig open wells.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Lack of employees in training centers - The onset of the health crisis reduced the number of people attending training centers, which could have otherwise provided residents with opportunities to learn new skills and improve their livelihoods.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Pollution - While the community has access to valuable natural resources such as coal and minerals, over-reliance on these resources for livelihoods can lead to environmental degradation and reliance on markets that are unstable.</li>
